## Goal 1: Display 5 Random German Words

*   **Objective:** Create a simple web page with a single button.

*   **Data Source:** For now, we will use a simple, hardcoded list of common German words within the application.
*   **Outcome:** A user can see 5 new words each time they click the button.
