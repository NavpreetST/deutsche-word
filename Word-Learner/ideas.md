# Ideas for Future Improvements

Once you have the basic application working, here are some ideas to expand on it:

*   **Add more levels:** A2, B1, B2, C1, C2.
*   **More word details:** Include the part of speech (noun, verb, adjective), gender for nouns (der, die, das), and example sentences.
*   **Different learning modes:**
    *   **Flashcards:** Show a word, guess the meaning, then reveal.
    *   **Quiz mode:** Multiple choice questions.
    *   **Typing test:** Type the correct German word for an English meaning.
*   **Use a real API:** Fetch words from a free dictionary API instead of a local file.
*   **User accounts:** Allow users to sign up and save their progress on a server.
*   **Spaced Repetition System (SRS):** An algorithm to show you words at increasing intervals to help you remember them better.
*   **Add audio:** Include pronunciation for the German words.
*   **Gamification:** Add points, streaks, and achievements to make learning more fun.
